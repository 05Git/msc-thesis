# Knowledge Fusion RL Policies for Fighting Games

Codebase for training ensemble fighting game policies as part of my dissertation on "knowledge fusion via adaptive expert policy weighting in fighting games".
1. Train expert policies through processes like reward shaping or imitation learning.
2. Use FuseNet to learn adaptive weights for each expert policy in each state.
   
This codebase requires [Diambra Arena](https://docs.diambra.ai/) and [Stable-Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/#) to run.
